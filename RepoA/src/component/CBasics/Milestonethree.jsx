Functions help you do things without rewriting the same code over and over.\n \n  You write the code once and use it whenever you need. Predefined functions are like ready-made tools that \n  you’ve already been using.\n \n  For instance, the main() function is a special one that runs your code, and printf() is another function \n  that shows text on the screen. You don’t have to create these functions yourself—they’re built into the \n  programming language for you to use.\n \n  Example:     int main() { \n                 printf('Hello World!'); \n                 return 0; \n                }"}</pre> renderQ={renderQ} />}

Name the function: Pick a name for your function.\n \n 2. Add parentheses: Put a pair of parentheses () right after the name.\n \n 3. Use curly brackets: Add curly brackets {} to show where the function’s code starts and ends. \n \n Syntax:     void myFunction() { \n               // code to be executed \n              } \n \n Example Explained:- \n \n • myFunction() is the name of the function \n \n • void means that the function does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later \n in the next chapter. \n \n • Inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do"}</pre> renderQ={renderQ} />}

They allow for the reuse \n of code and make programs easier to understand and maintain. Here’s a breakdown of function declaration\n and definition in C:\n\n 1. Function Declaration (Prototype): A function declaration, also called a function prototype, tells the\n compiler about the function’s name, return type, and parameters before the function is used in the program.\n It allows the compiler to ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters.\n\n Syntax:\n  return_type function_name(parameter_type1, parameter_type2, ...);\n\n 2. Function Definition:The function definition is where the actual code or body of the function is written.\n It tells the compiler what the function does when called. The function definition includes the same elements\n as the function declaration but also provides the code block (statements) that execute when the function is\n invoked.\n\n Syntax:\n return_type function_name(parameter_type1 param1, parameter_type2 param2, ...) {\n // Function body\n // Code to perform the task \n return value;  // Optional, if the return type is not void\n}"} </pre> renderQ={renderQ} />}

Calling a Function:\n Once a function is declared and defined, it can be called (invoked) in the program.

Instead of doing it all at once, you can use \n recursion to add two numbers at a time.\n\n Here’s a simple example:\n int sum(int k);\n int main() {\n   int result = sum(10);  // Start adding numbers from 10\n   printf('%d', result);  // Print the result\n   return 0;\n }\n int sum(int k) {\n if (k > 0) {   // If k is greater than 0\n   return k + sum(k - 1);   // Add k to the result of sum(k - 1)\n } else {\n return 0;  // If k is 0 or less, stop and return 0\n}\n  }\n\n "} </pre> renderQ={renderQ} />}
