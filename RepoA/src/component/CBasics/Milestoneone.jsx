It was created\n as an evolution of the B language, which itself was derived from BCPL (Basic Combined Programming\n Language)\n  \n 2. C was initially designed to improve the UNIX operating system. Before C, UNIX was written in assembly\n language, which was low-level and hardware-specific. The goal was to create a language that was powerful\n yet sufficiently abstract to write system software\n \n 3.C is a low-level, portable, structured language ideal for system-level programming, enabling modular\n and clean code development, and offering fast, efficient performance for performance-critical\n applications\n \n 4.K&R C, published in 1978, standardized the C programming language. ANSI C, introduced in 1989,\n provided a more consistent and portable version. ISO introduced C99 in 1999, which included new features.\n C11, introduced in 2011, improved multithreading and atomic operations. C18, introduced in 2018, made\n small adjustments to maintain consistency."} </pre> renderQ={renderQ} />}

These lines\n   start with a # symbol and are processed before the actual compilation of the code.\n   The most common directive is:#include <stdio.h>:\n   This directive includes the Standard Input/Output header file which provides functions like printf and \n   scanf used for input and output operations.\n  \n   2.Function Prototypes: Function prototypes declare the functions used in the program. They are usually \n   placed before the main() function, allowing the compiler to know about these functions before their \n   actual definition:void myFunction();:\n   This declares a function named myFunction that takes no arguments and returns no value (void).\n   Function   prototypes are optional but help organize code, especially larger programs.\n \n   3.Main Function: The main() function is the entry point of every C program. Execution of the program\n   begins here.\n   The main() function is defined as:        int main() {// Code goes here return 0;}\n \n   4.Variable Declarations & Code Statements: In the main() function, variables store data with a\n   specific data type.
