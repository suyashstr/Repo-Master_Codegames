These decision-making statements in programming languages decide the direction of\n the flow of program execution.\n \n Need of Conditional Statements \n \n There come situations in real life when we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions, we \n decide what should we do next. Similar situations arise in programming also where we need to make \n some decisions and based on these decisions we will execute the next block of code. \n \n C supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics: \n  \n   •Less than: a < b \n   •Less than or equal to: a <= b \n   •Greater than: a > b  \n   •Greater than or equal to: a >= b  \n   •Equal to a == b  \n   •Not Equal to: a != b  \n \n"}</pre> renderQ={renderQ} />}
